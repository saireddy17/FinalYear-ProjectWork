# Project Title: Modeling the Flow Behavior of Reduced Activation Ferritic-Martensitic Steel

## Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding the flow behavior of 9Cr-1W-0.06Ta Reduced Activation Ferritic-Martensitic (RAFM) steel under different conditions, specifically during Thermo-Mechanical Treatment (TMT) in Austenitic conditions. The study includes an in-depth analysis of material properties in both normalized and tempered (N+T) conditions, as well as during TMT in both Austenitic and ferritic field conditions.

## Objectives

The primary goal of the project is to develop a robust model for predicting the flow behavior of RAFM steel at elevated temperatures under N+T and TMT conditions. Specific objectives include:

- Comprehensive analysis of work hardening rates under different conditions.
- Investigation of microstructural changes through Optical, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM).
- Correlation of flow analysis results with microstructural investigations.

The abstract provides a concise summary of the project, outlining the key objectives, methodologies, and significant findings. It emphasizes the importance of the study in the context of nuclear energy applications.

## Keywords

Reduced Activation Ferritic-Martensitic (RAFM) steel, Thermo-Mechanical Treatment, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Precipitates, Austenitic Conditions, Flow Behavior Modeling.

## Literature Survey

The literature survey explores global initiatives such as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) and delves into nuclear fusion processes. It highlights the need for materials capable of withstanding extreme conditions in nuclear environments.

## Experimental Procedures

This section details the experimental procedures undertaken in the study. It includes information on the TMT process, temperature considerations, time frames, and the deformation applied to the material. The methods for microstructural investigations are also outlined.

## Experimental Results

The results section presents key findings, including microstructural changes observed through optical and electron microscopy. It covers variations in hardness and tensile behavior under different conditions (N+T, AF-TMT25, and FF-TMT25).

## Conclusions

The project's conclusions summarize the major findings and their implications. It highlights the positive effects of TMT on the microstructure, hardness, and tensile strength of RAFM steel, particularly in Austenitic conditions.
